PROJECT TITLE: Benny's Tower Defence 

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Grade 11 Computer Science Course Final Project

VERSION or DATE: Wednesday, January 20, 2021

AUTHORS: Benny Wu

USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
Click the "start button" to start the game. There are three levels in total, players have to place down different towers (Inferno, Lightning, Bomb) to stop the enemies from reaching to the end of the path. Players can upgrade their towers to improve damage and efficiency, and upgrade the gold mine to collect coins in a higher pace. Players can also use an awesome ability called "Mr. Chan's power" that can instantly wipe out half of the enemies on the map. It is considered as a win after players reach the end of the 3rd level, otherwise it is a loss.


REFLECTION:
There are certainly many challenges along the way. I was relatively unfamiliar with the Java language, therefore, it took me a tremendous amount of time to look up the syntax of many new ideas such as reading and writing from Text Files, and handling Array Lists. Also, I wasn't able to figure out the solution to many features that I wanted to implement into the game; which includes allowing the enemies to walk on a certain path, letting the inferno tower throw fireballs towards the enemies, pointing the head of the lighting strike on the correct direction, or even simply displaying a gif in the correct position. It took DAYS of testing for me to solve each problem. (LOL me and Steven sometimes literally spent 5 hours a day to solve one of these problems during Christmas break)

Nevertheless, I successfully solved most of the difficulties I have encountered while creating the game. My original plan is to hide a lot of Easter Eggs onto the map. For example, an airplane flying over the map, a crab dancing on the side of the screen, etc.
But I have eventually realized that I ran out of time, so I decided to give up on these unnecessary details. Still, I was able to finish the game despite underestimating the time it requires. Very grateful that I have the chance to learn coding in this amazing way. 

Have fun playing!
